2. Periodically checks
2.1. To check the Local for Neut and Reds
Note: overview should be set accordingly. All possibly dangerous entities must be marked with red non-blinking colortag.
In ver.2 we will distinguish Neuts and Reds and act accordingly
If local check fails, i.e. Red in system:
- sound signal
- proceed to Evacuation step (1.6.)
Option: to check neutral by kos cheker
- if there are too many players in local - goto ambush step 

2.2. To check overview for other player ship
If check fails, i.e. other player in "our" anomaly - consider action. At least sound signal.
2.3. To check NPC overview tab for small NPC ships.
If check fails, i.e. small NPC are present: proceed to step 1.5.
If no NPC found - easy mode evacuation (just scoop sentries and goto 1.3.)
2.4. To check sentries status periodically. 
If sentry is getting damage the easiest way is to re-Deploy. 
Check if in this case sentries can auto aggro.
Make sure to not react on already damaged sentries.
